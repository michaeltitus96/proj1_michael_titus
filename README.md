15 Puzzle Solver

To use, run the program and follow the instructions.

1. Input your starting position, putting spaces after each number and hitting "Enter" after each row. Put a "0" where the blank tile starts.
2. After the last row is entered, the program will run through the nodes and save the order that the blank tile moves about the puzzle.
3. Once the goal state is reached, the program will stop and output the order of the states from the intial state of the puzzle to the final state.
